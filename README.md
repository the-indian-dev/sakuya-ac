### Perfect and Elegant Anti Cheat for your YSFlight server
---
Well it started as an anti cheat... and now aims to add more features to make YSFlight more realstic server side
for vanilla clients.

## Test Server

I have a server running at ``9m.theindiandev.in`` and port ``7915``
with [2ch map](https://w.atwiki.jp/ysflight/pages/26.html) and latest version of
Sakuya AC and G Limiter at 20. It also has all the experimental options turned on.

## **Getting Started**

[Docmentation for Plugin API and advanced configuration](https://sakuya-ac.theindiandev.in/)

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.9+

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/the-indian-dev/sakuya-ac.git
   cd sakuya-ac
   ```

2. Edit `config.py` to match your server and client setup.
> **Warning**
> Please ensure that you have put the correct YSFlight version in YSF_VERSION variable in `config.py`. This is important for the proxy to work correctly.

3. Run the proxy server:
   ```bash
   python proxy.py
   ```
---

## **Configuration**
All configuration is done via the `config.py` file. Example:

```python
# config.py
SERVER_HOST = "127.0.0.1"  # YSFlight server IP
SERVER_PORT = 7915         # YSFlight server port
PROXY_PORT = 9000          # Port where the proxy listens
```

---

## **Usage**
1. Point your YSFlight client to the proxy server (e.g., `127.0.0.1:9000`).
2. Monitor logs to view real-time parsing and activity tracking.

---
## **TODO :memo:**
1. Add more detection rules.
2. Radar.
3. More documentation.
